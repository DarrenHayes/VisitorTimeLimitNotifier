# Envoy Visitor Time Limit Notifier

This Node.js application integrates with the [Envoy Platform](https://envoy.com/developers) to notify whether a visitor has exceeded their allowed time on-premises. Upon visitor **sign-out**, the app calculates their total duration and attaches a message to the visitor log if they overstayed their configured time limit.

## Features

- Accepts a setup parameter: allowed visit duration (0â€“180 minutes).
- Validates configuration on install via the Envoy dashboard.
- Responds to sign-out webhook events to check and report overstays.
- Deployable on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
